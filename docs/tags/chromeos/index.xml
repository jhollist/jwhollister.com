      <description>The only post I got around to writing in 2017 was a single messy, evoloving set of notes on how to set up a Chromebook with R and RStudio. This post is a reprise of that one as well as post #1 in my effort to double my blog output from 2017 (I&amp;rsquo;m shooting for the stars on that goal). In this post I will detail how to set up RStudio Server in a crouton chroot and access it directly via Chrome without having to fire up a separate X11 window.</description>

      <title>Setting up an Asus Flip C302CA Chromebook for R Development</title>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t think of this as a real blog post. It is mostly a loose collection of notes that I took while getting my new Asus Flip C302CA set up with R and RStudio. I&amp;rsquo;ve had this up and running for just a few days now (and in fact wrote this post using RStudio on it) and I love it. I highly recommend.
The steps below are not really tested. So if you run into problems or I have missed something, let me know.</description>
