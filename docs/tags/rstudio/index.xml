      <description>Several weeks ago, there was some activity on Twitter espousing the virtues RStudio projects, including a mention of Jenny Bryan’s post on Project-oriented workflow Reading through the tweets and re-reading Jenny’s post reminded me that even though many of us use Projects or other tools to organize our work, the specifics of our toolset and workflows are still likely unique and reflect a lot of personal decisions and preferences. The other thing that struck me is that aside from Jenny’s post, I have rarely seen these types of things documented (they may be, I just blissfully unaware).</description>

      <description>The only post I got around to writing in 2017 was a single messy, evoloving set of notes on how to set up a Chromebook with R and RStudio. This post is a reprise of that one as well as post #1 in my effort to double my blog output from 2017 (I&amp;rsquo;m shooting for the stars on that goal). In this post I will detail how to set up RStudio Server in a crouton chroot and access it directly via Chrome without having to fire up a separate X11 window.</description>

      <title>Setting up an Asus Flip C302CA Chromebook for R Development</title>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t think of this as a real blog post. It is mostly a loose collection of notes that I took while getting my new Asus Flip C302CA set up with R and RStudio. I&amp;rsquo;ve had this up and running for just a few days now (and in fact wrote this post using RStudio on it) and I love it. I highly recommend.
The steps below are not really tested. So if you run into problems or I have missed something, let me know.</description>
