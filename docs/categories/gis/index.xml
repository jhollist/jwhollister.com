      <description>At this years NEARC meeting I decided to give a lightning talk on using R as a GIS. As I was working on this I thought, &amp;ldquo;why not try a lightning demo?&amp;rdquo; That would be better than five minutes of slides on packages and commands. But, as anyone who has done a live demo will know, they often provide unexpected challenges. Add a 5 minute limit to that, and well, some level of failure is sure to occur.</description>

      <title>Download Shapefiles - Take 2</title>

      <description>So back in 2013 I posted a little function I wrote for grabbing all the relevant files that make up a shapefile from a URL. Turns out it doesn’t play so well with Windows 7 or Windows 8 (HT: John Lewis). Below is a reprised version that at least works on Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 7. Haven’t tested it beyond that and supressing the warnings to get httr::GET to not complain too much about FTP seems a bit unclean.</description>
