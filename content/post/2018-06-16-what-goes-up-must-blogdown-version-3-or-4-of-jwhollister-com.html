<p>So, I finally have my website up and running as a Blogdown/Hugo site. I have been meaning to make this switch for some time now, but never really found the time until recently. Writing up the gory details of my experience doesn’t seem like a good use of my time (nor your time to read it). This is because it wasn’t very difficult a process and many others have taken the time to put together really nice documentation. So, I’ll just link to the sites I used and say a word or two about the theme I used.</p>
<p>First, here are the links I found to be best:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">Blogdown Book</a></li>
<li><a href="https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/">Up and Running with Blogdown - Allison Presmanes Hill</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gohugo.io/documentation/">Hugo Documentation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Second, I struggled picking a theme. I didn’t want one that was too fancy, but many of the simple themes had things missing that I wanted. In the end, I chose one of the nicest (IMO) of the clean themes, Nan Xiao’s <a href="https://github.com/road2stat/hugo-tanka">Tanka</a>. I made a few small tweaks for my purposes. First, I wanted to be able to create some stand alone pages that would have dates listed on them or get added to the blog listing on the main page. Second, I made a few tweaks to colors, and Last, I add some fanciness with the Font Awesome icons on the menus.</p>
<p>All in all, an improvement over my old site and now I can be like the cool kids.</p>
